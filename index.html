                <p>
                    Meeseeks are creatures who are <b>created from a Mr.Meeseeks box to serve a singular purpose</b> for
                    which they will go to any length to fulfill.
                    After they serve their purpose, they expire and vanish into the air. Their motivation to
                    help others comes from the fact that <b> existence is painful to a Meeseeks</b>, and the only way to
                    be removed from existence is to complete the task they were called to perform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They typically live for no more than a few hours, and thus two days is an eternity for Meeseeks.
                    <b>The longer the Meeseeks stay alive, the more sanity they begin to lose</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a Meeseeks is not given a purpose at the beginning of its existence it seems to default to taking
                    the purpose of the
                    Meeseeks before it.
